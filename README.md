## Achive of COVID19 Memories

Hi, there. We have an idea to build a multilingual website to record the COVID19 memories globally. 

The site can be organized in a particular timeline using the number of days after the date that 100 cases verified, so maybe China is ahead of other country several weeks. The reason for this timeline is that the spreading of the virus is very similar in different countries. We will use machine translation to bridge the stories in different languages. 

Many projects like https://github.com/2019ncovmemory/nCovMemory are active on GitHub, but most of them are only record current events in one language, and few of them have a good website. This project may help to present their works to the public. 

We do believe different approaches are there to deal with the virus, so we are purely objective. 

This disaster is for our human all, and thus, it is worth to be recorded.
